To do so, Ga-JoL needs a new communication platform that will be coherent with their new brand universe and it will target new segment, which is Danish men 30+.

      "h3Des": "What we know is that all competitors have a strong online presence in social media and selling products online. Läkerol is the primary competitor with a clear positioning and online communication. Furthermore, Ga-JoL lacks digital marketing strategy and scores quite low on unique packaging and trendiness. Analysis showed that in order to increase sales Ga-JoL needs to be repositioned in a new market. But there are some strength of the Ga-JoL brand, which is its taste, originality, high brand awareness and a strong cultural heritage tied to the brand. Interviews revealed that chosen target audience is interested in products with innovative packaging and they would consider buying something only because of that. Danish man consider liquorice a trendy product at the time. Moreover, they do care about trendy products a lot and their main communication of choice is Instagram. The last finding says that they watch TV2 on a daily basis.",

The interview, survey and desktop research showed that the main issue is the limited amount of time for teacher’s lesson preparation, due to the reform, and the consequent frustration as the amount of pupils in classes is increasing. Developing a convenient solution that reduces the amount of preparation time, would enable teachers to focus more on the individual pupil. In order to further motivate teachers to use peer practice methods it is necessary to put emphasis on recognition and reward.",
      "h3Des1": "Being part of a community is important for teachers, therefore having a solution that focuses on interaction, contributing and learning together with peers would engage educators to participate. This can be achieved through new technological advancements as well as social media that can also be used to create brand awareness. Video, as one of teachers’ preferred tools (among presentations, pictures and interactive documents), is particularly functional in learning and sharing purposes when integrated with the peer practice methods. Feedback is essential to the peer practice method, so the solution will enable open discussions and live comments. Desktop research and the interview revealed that the main decision makers in the public school sector are municipalities, school administration and the principal of the school. The solution must therefore be appealing for them as much as it is for the users. If the teachers find this platform useful due to saving time and improving teaching skills, as well as student learning, then it is expected that teachers will spread the word about this platform and might catch the interest of principals of schools.",

Teachers can join teams and follow proficient colleagues, give/get feedback and create discussions both under the material, and in the forum section. The content quality will be monitored by &Learning. Each user will have a personalized feed, with the possibility to see the most popular material and posts from the peers they follow. There is a personal profile that enables users to fill in their CV info, and it also displays their level of experience and proficiency on the platform.

The mortgage interest rates are low and the period, when housing is on sale is very short in the bigger cities. 98% of the housing sales are handled by the real estate agencies, which indicates that they are a dominating choice over self selling and will still be around for a while. Research of digital trends in the real estate market worldwide has shown a clear pattern of companies utilizing modern technology to improve operational efficiency and staff productivity. The new technologies implemented are, for example, chatbots, virtual reality, voice search and blockchain, to name a few. The whole buying process overall is quite complicated for an unexperienced seller to handle alone, therefore, they prefer to have professionals handling it and guiding them through with advice. Competitors are trying to optimize and increase the efficiency of the selling process by utilizing technological advancements and automation. Digital platforms are used as helping tools for keeping the sellers involved. The current other real estate agencies’ digital tools resemble one another, and the only difference between them is that some can offer more in their online or offline services, and those are the areas they compete in. EDC positions itself as the leading real estate agency, their DNA is based highly on technological advancements, which are reflected in EDC’s online services.

Some of the characteristics that can be attributed to this target group come from the general sellers’ segment. One of the characteristics is that the customer segment chooses an agency based on the reputation of the individual agents. Another characteristic states that frequent in-person meetings are considered too time-consuming and other methods of communication, preferably on mobile devices, are favored. Research findings state, there are several target group’s pains and gains that are essential to address. In rural areas of Denmark, the most severe pain to solve is lack of interest from potential buyers, which results in a long selling period. Furthermore, sellers feel time pressured, because housing decreases in value over time, which results in a loss of investment. On the others hand, there is an opportunity to maximize on seller’s gains; attract more potential buyers, sell housing for a desirable price, and provide a guarantee that the housing will be sold. Based on some of the general customer’ segment characteristics that can also be applied to the target group and its pains and gains, a persona’s profile has been developed to summarize the target group.",

The guidance is provided by an interior designer and an agent by creating a shared list of tasks for the seller to complete through the mobile guidance tool called “MyChecklist”. It involves a summary of visual defects and potential improvements for the housing. Tasks can range from technical to interior design levels. These tasks are assigned by the real estate agent or an interior designer, since they have the necessary experience and technical knowledge to assess the mandatory improvements. The seller can access the list anytime of the day within his/her own convenience, and follow the current satus of the tasks in the list.",

Some other mentioned issues were that files take a lot of memory in the computer.

    "h1Des1": "During last few years I was working on products from various industries including manufacturing, education, insurance, transportation and media. I design informational architecture, user experience and user interface. I co-hosted various UX workshops in different stages of product design, from concept creation to alterations in already working systems. I love seeing how products are both well functioning and well designed, I believe this is due to well done problem solving, involving end users and other team members into the process.  From phases of product development I mostly enjoy system mapping and seeing how products come together. Personally, I believe in karma, I am a movie freak, music lover and weightlifting passionate.",
